LD38

- game is too "convenient" - needs arbitrary/obtuse challenges to spice things up and make it interesting, as opposed to just logisim 2.0
- possible obstructions include:
	- having to design around weird ass circuit board shapes
	- finishing partially completed circuits (which you can't edit)
	- parts shortages forcing you to solve puzzles by unconventional means
	- having to use multi-gate chips because Corporate bought them on the cheap
	- convoluted proprietary parts like the ones in Shenzhen I/O






patch notes:
- minor performance improvements
- fixed a couple minor graphical bugs
- made stable loops work correctly
- fixed a bug where the bridge didn't always show up in the parts list







resets:
- Branch Inverter
- Only One (XOR gate)
- Add Two (half adder)
- Add Three (full adder)
- Binary Addition
- Bit Counting







fixes:
- recalculate circuit on level load







refactors:
- fully repopulate shelf on level reload







features:
- a "clear" button! or just always clear between levels?
- skip non-essential levels
- zach-like category scores
	- online leaderboards + histograms
- saving and loading designs
- show passed and failed test cases
- extended test cases for complex puzzles
- more parts
	- OR gate?
	- multiplexer?
	- bit adder?
	- latch?
- specification editor?
	- user levels section?






levels:
- multi-match before the XOR gate puzzle to make it conceptually easier (one match triggers one output, the other match triggers the other)
- a level before Only One (XOR gate) that shows how power can flow backward, so people don't get confused and accidentally build a flip-flop

- multiplexer?
- bit counter
- bit counter + [already exists]
- latch
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
